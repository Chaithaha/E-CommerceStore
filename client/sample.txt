Front End - 

Welcome, (user) dropdown should have orange background with white text

Add navbar for create-post

Add field for create-post = market value

Product cards need to reflect fields in posts with actual numbers 

Battery health should only appear to phone/tablet category 

optional - multiple image upload

Authenticated as bar, shouldn't be a bar. make it a pop-up that appears for a second and goes away. Unauthenticated user shouldn't have to see the not 

authenticated bar. it should only show up as an error if an unauthenticated user got access to anything that needs authentication. (complex maybe?)

Backend maybe? - 

Battery health should only appear to phone/tablet category 

change categories to electronic based = Phone/Tablet, Home Appliances, Hardware, Computer Parts - (Supabase table might need to be updated?)
